  'Full Stack CRUD Web App',
  'project',
  'Overview: Build a full stack CRUD web app for a local service such as a clinic, repair shop, or tutoring center. The system must allow users to create, read, update, and delete records in a secure way. Use a relational database and a server side language of your choice. Your app must include user authentication, input validation, and a clear navigation flow. The app must handle at least two related entities and allow users to manage both without confusion.\n\nObjectives: Practice data modeling, routing, controllers, and views. Demonstrate how you design tables, connect to the database, and separate concerns in your code. Show that you can build a complete feature from UI to database and back. You must document how each route works and why each validation rule exists. Your code should be structured and easy to read.\n\nRequirements: Create at least two tables and a relationship between them. Example tables are Customers and Appointments or Students and Projects. Include a login form with password hashing. Add a dashboard that lists records and supports search or filtering. Build forms for create and edit actions. Prevent SQL injection by using prepared statements. Validate and sanitize all user input. Add basic error handling and friendly messages for invalid entries. Protect private routes with session checks.\n\nDeliverables: Provide a working demo with seed data. Add a README with setup steps, database schema, and screenshots. Include a short explanation of how to run migrations or import SQL. Add a list of assumptions and any limitations. Include a short video or screen capture walkthrough if possible.\n\nEvaluation: Your project will be assessed on code structure, security, UI clarity, and correctness of CRUD operations. Your database must remain consistent after repeated create and delete actions. The app should not break if a user submits empty or invalid data. The design does not need to be fancy but must be consistent and readable. We will check that records update correctly and that deletes require confirmation.\n\nSuggested plan: Start with the database schema and a simple list view. Then build create and edit forms. Add authentication and protect routes. Finally add search and polish. Test each feature with multiple records and edge cases. Ensure your delete action requires confirmation. Make sure your edit form is prefilled with current data. Add a logout action and session checks. Add server side validation for all fields.\n\nTesting and quality: Include a short test plan that lists at least ten manual test cases. Cover login, create, update, delete, search, and validation failures. Add a section on accessibility that checks color contrast, focus order, and keyboard navigation. Provide a simple deployment plan that explains how the app can run on a local server and how environment variables are stored. If you use an API, document each endpoint with method, input, and sample response. Describe how you used version control and how you organized commits. Explain how you separated concerns by using routes, controllers, and views or similar layers. Include a short performance note about indexing, pagination, and how you would reduce slow queries. Mention backup strategy and how you would restore data if the database is lost. Add a paragraph on user roles and permissions so that admins can manage records while regular users can only manage their own records. This section should show clear reasoning about data privacy and data ownership. Include a short reflection on what you learned and what you would improve next time.',

  'Data Analysis and Reporting Portfolio',
  'project',
  'Overview: Create a data analysis portfolio using a real or simulated dataset. The goal is to clean data, explore patterns, and present insights in a clear report. You must use spreadsheets or SQL for cleaning and at least one visualization tool for charts. The final output should read like a report for a manager or client. Your analysis should support a decision, not just describe the data.\n\nObjectives: Demonstrate data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and basic visualization skills. Show that you can ask the right questions, calculate metrics, and communicate findings in plain language. This task focuses on clarity and evidence based reasoning. You should be able to explain how your analysis leads to actions.\n\nDataset: Choose a dataset with at least 200 rows. It can be sales, student scores, clinic visits, or support tickets. If you create your own data, describe how you generated it and why it is realistic. Include a data dictionary that defines each column and the valid values.\n\nSteps: First, inspect missing values and duplicates. Document how you handle them. Second, compute key metrics such as totals, averages, and rates. Third, build charts that explain trends or comparisons. Fourth, write a short narrative summary that links the charts to practical recommendations. Fifth, create a one page dashboard or report view with the most important metrics.\n\nDeliverables: Submit a cleaned dataset, a report document, and a short slide deck with 5 to 7 slides. Your report should include an executive summary, a method section, findings, and recommendations. Provide queries or formulas used to compute metrics. Include at least three charts with clear labels and titles. Provide a small glossary of key terms.\n\nEvaluation: We look for correct calculations, consistent formatting, and logical conclusions. Your charts must match the data and show appropriate scales. Your writing should avoid jargon and focus on decision making. You should mention at least one risk or limitation in your analysis. You should explain why each chart was chosen.\n\nValidation and KPIs: Create a validation section that checks for outliers, incorrect data types, and inconsistent categories. Describe how you corrected errors and how many rows were affected. Add a section on key performance indicators that lists at least five KPIs with definitions. Explain why each KPI matters to the business. Build a simple dashboard layout that shows totals, trends, and comparisons. Include guidance on chart selection so that line charts are used for trends and bar charts are used for comparisons. Provide a paragraph on data ethics and privacy. Mention how you would anonymize personal data and why that is important. Add a small appendix that lists all formulas or SQL queries in a clean format. If you used pivot tables, explain how they were created and why they were used. End with recommendations that are specific and measurable. Include a short reflection on how you would automate parts of the process in the future.\n\nExtended analysis: Add a peer review step where another learner checks your calculations, charts, and narrative for clarity. Provide a short checklist for reviewers that includes chart labeling, correct totals, and alignment between findings and recommendations. Add a section on data governance that lists who owns the data, who can edit it, and how long it should be retained. Include a brief note on data refresh frequency and how dashboards should be updated. Provide a template for a monthly performance report and explain how it can be adapted for different audiences. End with a short paragraph on how you would validate your work using a second method such as a spot check or a sample calculation.\n\n',
